######### BASIC INFORMATION #########

# Further details about ERA5 can be found in:
# Hersbach, H, Bell, B, Berrisford, P, et al. The ERA5 global reanalysis.
# Q J R Meteorol Soc. 2020; 146: 1999â€“ 2049. https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3803

# For the download the functions of the ecmwfr R package are used:
# Hufkens, Stauffer and Campitelli (2019). The ecwmfr package: an interface to
# ECMWF API endpoints https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2647541

# In the example of this script 3 hourly 500 hPa geopotential data can be
# downloaded for December, January and February between 1981 and 2020
# from the ERA5 reanalysis, on a 2.5x2.5 horizontal grid.

### Required package ###
library(ecmwfr) # In order to download ERA5 data in R in NetCDF file format

### COMMENTS ###
# If surface data are required then "levtype" = "sfc" could be used
# instead of "pressure_level" = "500".

# The names of the variable in case of air pressure, 2m temperature and precipitation are:
# "surface_pressure", "2m_temperature" and "total_precipitation".
    
# If older versions of the ecmwfr package are used then "dataset"
# shall be used as parameter name instead of "dataset_short_name".
